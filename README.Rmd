# Indiana COVID-19 Tracker
(Charts updated between noon and 1pm ET and at 6:30 pm ET)

Repository to track COVID-19 data statewide and by county. State and County data for positive tests and deaths are gathered from The New York Times COVID-19 [repository](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and the Indiana State Department of Heath Twitter [account](https://twitter.com/StateHealthIN?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor). State policy [data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zu9qEWI8PsOI_i8nI_S29HDGHlIp2lfVMsGxpQ5tvAQ/edit#gid=0) comes from Julia Raifman, Kristen Nocka, et al at Boston University.  

```{r}
ind_line_path <- glue::glue("plots/ind-combo-line-{params$ind_combo_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(ind_line_path)
``` 

   * Each point is the total cases that have accumulated until that date. The lines show the exponential nature of the spread of the virus at the beginning of the epidemic and changes in trend as policy and behavior changes.  
   * *Doubling time* is the amount of time it would take for the current total to double. It assumes that the rate of change is constant. The doubling time shown here assumes that the total change from yesterday to today (i.e. single day *growth rate*) will remain constant in the future. As we'll see in another chart, it's not a valid assumption in this situation, but it's interesting as a hypothetical. 
   * The equation for doubling time, T~d~, where r is the growth rate.

```{r ,align="center"}
pos_policy_path <- glue::glue("plots/pos-policy-line-{params$pos_policy_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(pos_policy_path)
```
  
   * This chart shows the number of daily positive cases on the y-axis versus the cumulative total of positive cases on the x-axis, where both axes are on a logarithmic scale. As policy measures are taken and the transmission rate lessens, the trend will decline and become increasingly vertical.  

```{r, align="center"}
density_pos_path <- glue::glue("plots/density-pos-line-{params$density_pos_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(density_pos_path)
```

   * This chart shows the single day growth rates over a period of time for each state. LOESS regression curves are used here instead of a connected line graph of the actual data because the fluctuations of the data would obscure the trends.  
   * These curves can be used to compare the effectiveness of state responses. Population density is a potential factor for how quickly a virus spreads through a state. Therefore, a fairer comparison might be to use states with similar population densities if we want to get an idea of how well Indiana's governmental response has been.  
   * Doubling times, as shown in the previous equation, are calculated from growth rates, so I've included a second y-axis to show how these have changed over time as well.  
   * Previous versions of this chart included Georgia. As of 2020-04-12, Georgia started separating non-state residents from their patient counts. Neither The New York Times nor Georgia adjusted the counts prior to the change. Without an adjustment, it destroyed the coherence of the data, so I've replaced them with South Carolina.  

```{r, align="center"}
region_dea_path <- glue::glue("plots/region-dea-line-{params$region_dea_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(region_dea_path)
```

```{r, align="center"}
region_pos_path <- glue::glue("plots/region-pos-line-{params$region_pos_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(region_pos_path)
```

   * The y-axis has been transformed to the log base-10 scale. Slopes and trends of straight(-ish) lines are easier to compare than exponential curves.  
   * 7-day moving averages *greater* than 14 day moving averages indicate an *increasing* trend of positive cases or deaths.  
   * 7-day moving averages *less* than 14 day moving averages indicate a *decreasing* trend in positive cases or deaths. 

```{r, align="center"}
county_pos_path <- glue::glue("plots/county-pos-bar-{params$county_pos_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(county_pos_path)
```

   * The top 20 counties according to estimated average percent change are shown. Counties at the top are experiencing the highest average growth rates in positive test results.
   * The percent changes are estimated using county data in a log-linear model.  
   * Only counties that have had at least 5 positive cases for a week or more are considered. I'm trying to weed out the high rate estimates that are due to a spike in testing.  As tests become more widely available, I'll remove this constraint.  
  
```{r}
daily_re_path <- glue::glue("plots/daily-re-line-{params$daily_re_date}.png")
knitr::include_graphics(daily_re_path)
``` 

   * The instantaneous effective reproduction number, R~e~ is an estimate of the average number of people that an infected person is spreading the virus to for that period. Estimates slightly larger than 1 indicate a slow spread of the virus. Estimates of 2 or greater mean the virus is spreading rapidly.
   * Further details on this metric can be found at a research [site](https://cbdrh.github.io/ozcoviz/#national-level-r_t) set-up by South Western Sydney Clinical School and the Centre for Big Data Research in Health.
