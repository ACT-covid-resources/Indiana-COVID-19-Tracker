## Changelog

  - 2020-04-12 - Georgia started separating non-state residents from
    their patient counts. Neither The New York Times nor Georgia
    adjusted the counts prior to the change. Without an adjustment, it
    destroyed the coherence of the data, so I’ve replaced them with
    South Carolina in the daily growth rate chart.  
  - 2020-05-07 - The New York Times
    [decided](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/PROBABLE-CASES-NOTE.md)
    to combine “probable” and “confirmed” positive cases and deaths in
    their datesets so that the data would remain consistent across all
    states. I think it provides a more accurate description of what’s
    going, so I’ve decided to keep their data source and discard Indiana
    State Department of Health’s (ISDH). The ramification is that many
    charts’ data will be a day late. Hopefully ISDH will opensource
    their probable cases and probable deaths, so the charts can return
    to being up-to-date.
